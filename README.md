# The Internet's Common Room

Inspired by the Hogwarts Common Rooms, this is a place for the internet to come together and share their thoughts, ideas, and creations in real time, without it being stored anywhere.

## Pre-requisites

Run the server:

```bash
cd server
bun install
bun start
```

## To run the client, root directory:

```bash
bun install
bun start
```
